## Description

Test your knowledge of water with this trivia game! There are ten quetions in total, but only 5 will be randomly selected with each playthrough.

## Motivation
To practice using timers, I wanted to make a timed trivia game. I love water, so I made the questions water-based!

## Results
Currently, a working version of the app is complete. I was able to add some nice CSS features to polish it a bit.

## Work Load
TriviaGame is a solo project completed entirely by me.

## Challenges
The dynamic CSS where the options would stay highlighted once clicked gave me the most trouble. I was able to solve that by setting the css 'color' attribute dynamically with JQuery using onClick and looking at its current color.

## Improvements
I think the app would flow more nicely if there was a way to submit the answer instead of waiting for the timer to count down to 0.

## Technologies used:
- JQuery
